          <h2>Future Career</h2>
          <p>After graduating from high school and college I wish to become a Electrical Engineer Specializing in Radio/Radar and Control Systems. This career field interests me because I could never understand how radar's in aircraft are able to detect weather and other aircraft from so far away, and would like to work for aircraft manufactureres developing future radar advancements. I also find control systems interesting because I want to work designing the critical parts of aircraft that allow them to soar in the sky.</p>
          <h2>Potential Future Employers</h2>
